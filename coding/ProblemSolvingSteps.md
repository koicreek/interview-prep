# Problem Solving Steps

1. Verify the constraints
    - Determine what varies and to what degree it varies
2. Write out some test cases
    - Happy path + edge cases + unsolvable inputs
3. Identify logical steps to solve problem, i.e. no code
4. Write logical steps in code
5. Review code for errors & typos
6. Test code solution with test cases
7. Analyze space & time complexity
8. Optimize solution (logical steps)
    - Repeat steps 4-7
        - Code optimal solution
        - Review for errors
        - Run test case(s) through code
        - Analyze space & time complexity



## Sample Q's for Constraint Verification

1. Verify the constraints
    - Are all numbers positive? Is zero allowed?
    - Are input data values unique, or can there be duplicates?
    - Will there always be a solution to the given inputs?
        - What to return if there is no solution?
    - Can there be multiple solutions based on a set of inputs?
        - If so, do we want to return all solutions, or just the first one found?
